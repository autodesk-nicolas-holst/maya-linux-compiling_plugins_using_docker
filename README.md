# maya-linux-compiling_plugins_using_docker

This is an attempt at being able to build plugins for different versions of Maya on a single machine. The problem is that different versions of Maya require different OS versions, compiler versions etc. By using a couple of dockers you can build the plugin for multiple Maya versions on a single machine.
